  I'm a software engineer well-versed in JavaScript with experience in React, Redux, Gatsby, Next.js, PHP, Laravel, and SQL. I think about code organization more than I would like to admit and have been using principles of Atomic Design for component hierarchy, CSS-in-JS for styling, and Storybook for visual testing.
