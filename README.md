  I'm a software engineer well-versed in JavaScript/TypeScript with experience in React, Next.js, Gatsby, GraphQL, Jest, RTL, Cypress, CSS-in-JS, and Storybook. I’m passionate about creating scalable, maintainable solutions and thrive on solving challenges in code organization. Lately, I’ve been particularly excited about leveraging Astro for building fast, modern websites and exploring TanStack libraries for routing, data fetching, and advanced table management.
